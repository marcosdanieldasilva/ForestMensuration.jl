Documentation for [ForestMensuration](https://github.com/marcosdanieldasilva/ForestMensuration.jl).

**ForestMensuration.jl** is a Julia package that offers a comprehensive suite of functions for dendrometric calculations. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, it streamlines complex forestry computations through an intuitive interface. Key features include:

- **Regression Analysis**: Seamlessly fit linear models—complete with variable transformations and handling of categorical data—to uncover the best relationships in your forestry datasets.
- **Tree and Stand Volume Estimation**: Accurately compute tree and stand volumes using a range of methods, including Huber, Smalian, and Newton techniques.
- **Site Productivity Classification**: Implement advanced methods to evaluate and classify the productivity and quality of forest sites.
- **Dendrometric Averaging**: Easily calculate essential metrics such as mean diameter, quadratic mean diameter, and other averages to analyze stand structure.
- **Frequency and Diametric Tables**: Generate detailed frequency and diameter distribution tables to support comprehensive data analysis.

Whether you are conducting research or managing forestry operations, **ForestMensuration.jl** simplifies the process of analyzing dendrometric data, enabling you to perform sophisticated calculations with minimal effort.

## About the Author

I am Marcos Daniel da Silva, a Forest Engineer with a strong interest in forest mensuration and data analysis. I developed the ForestMensuration.jl package as part of my final course project in Forest Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Maria campus Frederico Westphalen (UFSM), under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Rafaelo Balbinot (UFSM) and Prof. Dr. Alexandre Behling (UFPR). This package represents my dedication to providing accessible tools for forestry professionals and researchers, aiming to simplify complex dendrometric calculations and forest inventory analyses using the Julia programming language.
