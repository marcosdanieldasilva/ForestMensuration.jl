Approximately 16% of the trees have diameters below d₋. This metric represents one standard deviation below the mean diameter and is useful for understanding the variability and distribution of diameters within the stand.\nd̄: Mean diameter, the arithmetic mean of the diameters. It is a basic measure of central tendency but can be influenced by thinning practices. The mean diameter is a fundamental measure but can be significantly affected by the removal of smaller or larger trees during thinning operations.\ndg: Quadratic mean diameter, calculated using the mean basal area as dg = sqrt((40000 * mean(g)) / π), where g is the basal area of each tree. It closely approximates the diameter of the tree with mean basal area and is less affected by extreme values or thinning. This metric provides a better estimate for volume calculations and is less sensitive to variations in the data.\ndw: Weise's diameter, the diameter at which 60% of the trees have smaller diameters (the 60th percentile). It approximates the diameter of the tree with mean volume. Weise's diameter is considered a good approximation of the diameter of the tree with mean volume and is less influenced by thinning practices.\ndz: Diameter of the tree with central basal area, calculated from the median basal area as dz = sqrt((40000 * median(g)) / π). It represents the diameter that divides the stand's total basal area into two equal parts, effectively splitting the cumulative basal area. This metric is less influenced by the removal of smaller trees and provides insight into the stand's structure.\nd₁₀₀: Mean diameter of the 100 largest trees per hectare. If there are fewer than 100 trees per hectare, it returns NaN. This metric provides insight into the size of the largest trees in the stand, which can be important for management objectives like timber production.\nd₊: Upper Hohenadl's diameter, calculated as (d̄ + s).
